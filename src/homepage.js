<p className="homeparagraph">Hi! My name is Vincent Kuan and I am a graduate at Seneca College, majoring in Computer Programming. I am currently looking
for an entry-level software developer position</p>

<p>My first experience with computer programming was in high school with Turing and Web Development. </p>
<p>At the time, I decided to study Opticianry in post-secondary school but was always interested in software development and technologies as it continued to evolve over the years.</p>
<p>After a few years studying Opticianry @ Seneca College, I decided to study Computer Programming because I enjoy it.</p>

<p>Here is where I put my projects that I have worked on, while continuing to create better and more projects in the future.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my page!</p>
